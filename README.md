# Redux Router Skeleton

Simple skeleton project ready to be used in everything you want! :)

This is the first step to initialize a project in React Js with 
Redux + React Router

It's prepared with the next libraries:

* [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) - Official React bindings for Redux 
* [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) - DOM bindings for React Router
* [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) - Ruthlessly simple bindings to keep react-router and redux in sync
* [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps 
* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) - Thunk middleware for redux
